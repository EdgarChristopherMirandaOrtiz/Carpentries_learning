Where I'm learning carpentries 

## Project Organization and Management for Metagenomics

### Documents before sent DNA or RNA off for sequencing

- Spreadsheet od the data of our experimente (whatever we were measuring)
- Lab notebook
- The data of the samples
- How we're goint to sequence (DNA or RNA, pair-single-end, Illumina?, what we expect?)

### Creating a github space →  README file

- Date format for documents (dd,mm,yyyy)
- Meaning abbreviations
- Meaning or pattern of IDs samples
- Detailed methodology
- Information of authors
- Meaning and names of variables

### Ethical considerations → Microbiome

- Respect → Sign explicit prior informed consent
- Do good → Participant's privacy
- Do no harm → Policy of results communications
- Do no harm → Invasivness of sampling and minimize risks
- Act justly → Favor disversity of subjects and justice

### Structuring data in spreadsheet

- [1] Raw data remains as raw data
- [2] Observations in its on row
- [3] Variables in columns
- [4] use "_" instead of spaces
- [5] Separet info
- [6] CSV format
- [7] Fill with "0"
- [8] no tabs, no tabless
- [9] optimal file name

### Laaaaaaaarge data sets

They could use a lot of **disc space**, since we have the large data sets and its **pipelines** including intermediate and result files. As a resutls identifiying **errors is complex**. 

### Retrieving sample sequenceing data from Sequence Center

- Samples are organized by sample_ID
- The _R1 and _R2 mean Read1 and Read2, like for 5'-3' and 3'-5'
- **.gz** → means "gzip", that is compressed

### Storing dat

- Accesible at least for the head and others team member access
- Place redundantly backed up and in different locations
- Raw data reamins raw data

### Public data

Almost all analysis use **reference data**, and we may want to **compare our results** and **annotate** data in our sequences. 

When we want to publish a paer we surely will need to **public our sequencing data**. This sharing makes our **paper more likely to be re-used and cited**

- NCBI → National Center for Biotechnology Information
- ENA → European Nucleotide Archive (EMBL-EBL)
- SRA → Sequence Read Archive

### Accesing data (EXAMPLE)

**Paper name:** Genomic adaptations in information processing underpin trophic strategy in a whole-ecosystem nutrient enrichment experiment

**Doi:** https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.49816
